# The above selects the 9 transitions where the diff_harmonicity is less than
# 0.15. It seems that this is the threshold (just eyeballing it) where things
# start to become a little hairy for performers, and it may be good to have a
# transition in between the two.
#
# Therefore, the diff ratio should be factored into two ratios that, when
# multiplied together, lead to the resulting ratio.
#
# 1. Take the factors of each the numerator and denominator of the diff
# 2. Examine if any of these possible transitions have a harmonicity > 0.15
# 3. Find hopefully a midpoint between the two elements
